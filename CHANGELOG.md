# OpenMinion Changelog

Status: active
Last updated: 2026-11-13

This file tracks package-facing release notes for `openminion`.

## Unreleased

- Upstream header request IDs (`X-Request-ID`) in shared provider error facts are now bounded
  to 128 characters, matching body request ID normalization across HTTP and SSE error paths (Refs #740).

- The README's Python `Agent` snippet now declares `lookup_order` as
  `@tool(min_scope="READ_ONLY", idempotent=True)`, matching
  `examples/sdk/tool_agent.py`: the bare `@tool` was classified as a write with
  unknown reversibility, so under the default action policy the snippet ended at
  a confirmation prompt instead of the answer. The `tool()` docstring and
  `docs/runtime-surfaces.md` now describe how `min_scope`, `idempotent` and
  `dangerous` map to approval; `tags` and `capabilities` do not declare risk.
  Policy behavior is unchanged (Refs #745).

- `docs/turn-budgets.md` now documents automatic fact extraction: the supported
  top-level `brain.auto_fact_extraction` switch and its six defaults, model
  selection from the effective agent profile, the auxiliary structured call it
  adds when it runs, and the conditions that skip it. It also notes that an
  `auto_fact_extraction` key under `agents.<id>` currently has no effect.
  Behavior is unchanged (Refs #746).

## Current package line - 2026-11-13

- `examples/sdk/delegation.py --mode handoff --approval deny` now reports a denial only
  when the run actually ended at the handoff confirmation; an ordinary answer with no
  confirmation is printed unchanged, and the pause guidance is no longer shown after a
  denial. Pause, allow_once and the approval callback are unchanged (Refs #526).

- `build_delegate_tool` now dumps Pydantic `BaseModel` outputs from `Handoff` target
  agents with `model_dump(mode="json")` so delegated structured results serialize cleanly
  in `ToolExecutionBatch.to_metadata_payload()` while leaving non-model outputs and run
  metadata unchanged.

- `daemon start` now creates the `state/` and `logs/` parents under the storage
  private-directory contract instead of the process umask: the startup owner made them
  first at 0755, so the later storage helper preserved them and the daemon database and
  its WAL stayed reachable through a world-readable directory. A caller-owned directory
  keeps its own mode (Refs #618).

- The published wheel and sdist now carry the approval criteria resources: the four
  `modules/brain/runtime/approval/criteria/*.md` files were present in the release tree
  but omitted from both artifacts, so the exported `default_criteria_registry()` raised
  `FileNotFoundError` for `git_reset_hard.md` in an installed environment. They are now
  declared as package data (Refs #678).

- Cancelling an active turn while waiting on tool or sidecar approval now aborts
  execution instead of falling through the operator-denial path and racing gateway
  persistence as `completed`: stream and inline approval callbacks propagate
  turn cancellation immediately, pending canonical confirmations settle as denied
  without running the tool, and gateway outbound persistence checks cancellation
  before writing a successful terminal run state (Refs #527).

## Current package line - 2026-11-09

- Added session-scoped delegated-task inspection for Desktop, including safe job
  structure, observability identifiers, and a payload-redacted A2A timeline.
- Preserve explicit cancelled turns across the daemon and runtime manager so
  Desktop's stop-and-run-next flow advances the retained queue instead of
  entering failure repair, while deadline timeouts remain failed turns.
- Approval for a destructive invocation is bound to the exact once-grant payload and
  consumed exactly once: a second `check_command` for the same command requires a new
  confirmation, and the exhaustion assertion is back in the integration test so the
  binding cannot regress silently (Refs #642).

- `/model setup` now shows the provider list inside its own prompt instead of printing
  it to the console first: the overlay takes the screen before the prompt appears, so the
  numbered menu was never visible and the connection had to be chosen from memory. The
  menu is repeated when an entry is rejected (Refs #707).

- A provider factory no longer substitutes `echo` when the config names no usable
  default agent: a missing or unknown `default_agent` in a multi-agent catalog now
  raises the canonical `UnknownProfileError` from `build_provider` and
  `build_runtime_llm_handle` instead of silently building echo. A single-agent
  catalog, an explicitly selected default and an echo agent keep working, and an
  empty catalog still resolves to echo (Refs #650).

- Document that `modules/brain/runtime/approval` has no in-tree production caller:
  the policy confirmation flow remains the owner of destructive-action approval, and
  the approval helper's `enabled` flag defaults to false (Refs #678).
- A same-session context rebuild now treats the rendered `gateway_system_context` as
  pack identity: the runtime cache lookup key and `pack_version` include the stripped
  gateway context, so changing that input returns the newly rendered bytes instead of
  the previous pack's cached bytes (Refs #644).
- Slack Socket Mode keeps an import-time fault out of its install guidance: only a
  `ModuleNotFoundError` that names `slack_sdk` itself and leaves no resolvable spec
  raises `MissingSlackSocketDependency` with the extra name, while a fault raised
  inside an installed SDK - its own `__init__` or a dependency it imports - propagates
  as itself. HTTP mode and injected-client paths are untouched (Refs #651).
- A malformed plan `criterion_ids` value is now rejected instead of defaulted: an
  explicitly supplied `false`, `{}` or `null` reaches `TaskPlan` validation and emits
  `task_plan.invalid_trailer`, where the truthiness default silently turned it into an
  empty criteria list and the plan was accepted. The field stays an optional array — no
  null is accepted — and an absent key or `[]` still declares with no criteria
  (Refs #649).

- `subagent()` now populates `SubagentRunContext.tool_allowlist` from the child
  `Agent`'s resolved tool names (`tuple(child.tools)`) instead of raw `tools`
  items, so `@tool`-decorated callables work in `subagent(parent, tools=[...])`
  without raising `TypeError` when inbound metadata is projected (Refs #703).

- `write_decision_memory` and `_stage_tool_outcome_candidate` now read
  `runner._memory_write_allowed_for_turn` directly instead of defaulting a
  missing attribute to `True` via `getattr`, while preserving `BrainRunner`'s
  standalone constructor default and per-turn service policy evaluation
  (Refs #647).

- A malformed MCP `tools/call` arguments value is no longer treated as an omitted
  one: only an absent field defaults to an empty object, so a supplied `null`, `false`,
  `0`, `""` or `[]` now returns `-32602` without invoking the tool instead of running it
  as if nothing had been passed. Omitted and empty-object calls, and the separation
  between invalid requests and tool-level failures, are unchanged (Refs #658).



- A truncated tool result now tells the model that its output is partial: the tool
  message carries `truncated`, `returned_length` and `total_length` when the result was
  actually truncated, and carries nothing extra otherwise (Refs #675).



- The env-guard validator now fails on a rule whose path no longer exists, and the
  fourteen stale rules behind that check are removed so a re-created path cannot
  inherit an old allowance (Refs #668).



- New storage directories are created private (0700) before any database, sidecar or
  log is written, so the 0644 files SQLite creates are not readable by other users; an
  existing directory keeps its own mode (Refs #618).
- Report failures that reach the terminal renderer as one scriptable line instead of a
  traceback: exit 1 with an `INTERNAL_ERROR` envelope (`--json`) or a single stderr
  line, and the verbose verbosity source — the flag, `OPENMINION_VERBOSITY` or the saved
  preference — re-raises so the traceback stays available. `ConfigError`, `RuntimeError`
  and `KeyError` keep their existing exit-2 handling at every verbosity, startup before
  dispatch is unchanged, and programming errors such as `TypeError` keep their
  traceback. SIGINT/SIGTERM cancel the
  one-shot `run` command immediately (exit 130/143) instead of waiting for an in-flight
  provider thread. The handlers belong to the process entry points — the `openminion`
  console script and `python -m openminion` — so an imported `main()` never takes a
  host's signals or its cleanup, even for `run` (Refs #629).



- `daemon stop` now verifies the recorded PID before signalling it: the process must
  carry the exact `-m openminion.daemon serve` launch form with matching `--config`,
  `--pid-file`, `--host` and `--port`, and the PID file must still name it on a final
  reread, the process executable must still be a Python launcher, and missing,
  unreadable, duplicated or contradictory identity is refused without a signal
  (Refs #616).

- File tools reject non-string `path` values instead of stringifying them: an
  integer, list or object path is now `invalid_arguments`/`type_mismatch` rather
  than a `NOT_FOUND` lookup of `str(value)` (Refs #666).





- `daemon start` now reports a child that exited before answering separately from a
  live timeout: the observed exit code, the requested endpoint and the log path (or
  that no log file was written), instead of always blaming a health timeout
  (Refs #617).

- Scope synchronous A2A retries by the declared sender, destination, method,
  and session. Reusing a key with different arguments returns
  `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` (HTTP 409). Matching legacy call records also return
  a conflict because they lack the sender and argument binding. The handler
  is not dispatched in either case (Refs #670).

- Strengthen developer safeguards for brain and core changes: detect reverse
  dependency imports across supported static import forms and run policy,
  closure, replay and steering contracts in the fast regression suite.

- Pass current-turn steering to the closure judge in the order it was applied,
  preserving the rest of the user's request when the judge revises the final
  answer (Refs #661).

## Current package line - 2026-11-06

- Carry user corrections into the final answer and retries when the agent
  detects repeated tool calls (Refs #660).

- Document the handoff approval pause in `examples/sdk/delegation.py` and the
  SDK examples README. A handoff without an `approval_callback` returns the
  policy prompt (`respond_kind` `policy_confirmation_prompt`), not the target's
  answer; the example's `--approval` flag now shows the pause plus explicit
  allow/deny operator decisions, where denial keeps the target from running
  (Refs #526).

- Declare `lookup_order` in `examples/sdk/tool_agent.py` as a read-only,
  idempotent tool. Since 0.1.11 the bare `@tool` was classified as
  `write`/unknown reversibility, so the example stopped at a confirmation
  prompt under the default action policy (#464). Approval logic and the
  unknown-risk default are unchanged.

- Carry user corrections into the answer and any answer-only retry when the tool
  budget runs out. Apply corrections in order and preserve unchanged request
  requirements (Refs #659).

- Keep synchronous A2A call reservations exclusive even after they age past
  the recovery threshold. A repeated key returns `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` when an old
  reservation has no receipt or the result could not be published. Reconcile
  the downstream effect before reissuing the call with a new key.

- Recover one identical transient safe read and one guarded file overwrite after
  a contradictory complete readback. Preserve duplicate suppression after a
  successful write with LF, CRLF or CR content, recheck permissions and budgets,
  and refuse stale replacement preconditions.

- Preserve runtime-tool schema definitions when adding task updates. Include
  tool schemas and structured messages in task request budget checks, bound
  explicit output limits by the remaining allowance, and debit each returned
  entry retry. Preserve unset output limits and plain text answers; require a
  valid task update before executing an uncommitted change. Reserve required
  task context and schemas before trimming optional entry context.

- Carry bounded, revisioned task conditions through clarification and execution
  (Refs #529). Entry can return user-grounded condition deltas alongside its
  existing action; unchanged conditions survive, corrections overwrite their
  keys, and explicit replacement detaches the previous local workflow. Preserve
  pending-question context for short answers, retain state across restarts, and
  stop execution on invalid updates or insufficient context capacity. Reuse the
  execution context owner and canonical tool replay without duplicate tool-event
  excerpts. Source tests do not establish live-model semantic accuracy or
  installed-package verification.

- Honour `runtime.agent_loop_tool_result_max_chars`: the setting was declared and
  range-checked but never read, so inline tool output was always framed at the
  hardcoded 8192-character threshold. The configured value now drives it, so the
  4000 default takes effect for existing configurations; raise the setting to 8192
  to keep the previous threshold (Refs #604).

- Reconcile research child budget consumption before allocating the next pass,
  and include their terminal tool results in the turn's tool/error statistics.
  Preserve isolated child state and settle consumption on partial, failed and
  cancelled execution; resumed findings do not charge completed work again.
  Whole-turn LLM response reporting continues to use the existing canonical
  event projection introduced by #596 (Refs #531, Refs #542).

- Document `file.read`'s numeric arguments (character offset, default and maximum
  length) and return `next_offset` plus a continuation hint when a read is
  truncated, so following a large file no longer means deriving the window by hand
  (Refs #605).

- Retain a completed research child's answer ahead of raw tool-output prefixes,
  with the existing source URLs and evidence references. Use a successful
  action summary when the completed message is empty and usable tool evidence
  exists. Keep partial-child evidence salvage and the 200/800-character prompt
  projections unchanged (Refs #543).

- Require a subcommand for `openminion status` and `openminion service`: a bare
  group now prints that group's usage and exits 2 instead of falling through to
  the no-handler interactive/onboarding route (Refs #591).

- Check Focus terminal layout against one screen-and-cursor snapshot so resize
  repaint fragments cannot invalidate an already accepted test frame. Preserve
  the compositor assertions and existing wait limits (Refs #610).

- Await async `@tool` handlers in the shared execution path: an `async def` tool
  registered successfully but was never awaited, so callers received a coroutine
  object instead of the handler's return value (Refs #612).

- Make identity `clear_cache` prefix matching case-sensitive, so it no longer deletes other agents' snippets through a case-insensitive `LIKE`. (Refs #485)

- Forward the query string on POST requests, so query-parameter POST routes resolve their parameters. (Refs #486)

- Accept `pattern` as an alias for `file.search`'s `query`, matching the argument
  name `file.find` uses, and say in the description that it is a content search
  rather than a glob (Refs #606).

- Expand cron day-of-week ranges before normalizing Sunday-as-7, so ranges that contain Sunday parse correctly. (Refs #488)

- Honour the root `--session` value for one-shot `run`: the subcommand declared
  its own `--session` with a default, which overwrote the root value so
  `openminion --session <id> run ...` silently ran in `cli-run` (Refs #593).

- `daemon stop` now names the resolved endpoint and the expected PID-file path when
  the endpoint answers but no PID file exists, states that nothing was signalled,
  and still exits 1 instead of a bare reachable-without-PID line (Refs #592).

- Describe `--dir` accurately: it selects the interactive workspace and the
  one-shot `run` tool root, and the root-option form must precede the command
  (Refs #594).

## Current package line - 2026-11-04

- Add a reviewed learning lifecycle that can retain successful substantive
  work, author a procedure, evaluate transfer separately, and admit or roll
  back an exact agent-scoped version. Application remains pending until an
  operator admits it, and the available source support does not establish a
  live learning-benefit claim.

- Add finite read-only recurring security assessments with visible consumed
  and remaining attempts, separate latest-attempt and last-successful evidence,
  and exact-task pause and resume controls. Source support is available, but
  the composed live lifecycle has not completed acceptance and does not provide
  unlimited monitoring, autonomous repair, or security certification.

- Account for LLM responses across a whole turn, including reflection, action,
  judgment, and continuation steps, in public stats and persisted usage facts.
  Preserve reported cache usage and missing-usage coverage, and prevent call-event
  replay from counting tokens twice (Refs #516). Child tool-result accounting and
  research budget settlement remain separate (#531, #542).

- Ratchet `skip`/`skipif`/`xfail` markers in the test suite against a per-file
  baseline, so silencing a case becomes a counted, reviewed change: adding a
  marker fails the build, and a literal conditional skip turned unconditional
  fails even when the total is unchanged. Only literal marker forms are
  classified; the count records which markers apply, not whether a case runs
  (see `CODE_QUALITY.md`).

- Log the identity-profile fallback at `DEBUG` instead of `WARNING`: a missing
  identity profile is the default state, so a stock install no longer warns on
  every single turn (Refs #572).

- Run one-shot `run` turns with the caller's working directory as the tool
  workspace root when `runtime.tool_workspace_root` is unset, so file tools see
  the files the user is working on; an explicit `--dir` overrides a configured
  root (Refs #575).

- Treat a `4xx` daemon response as the definitive answer instead of falling back
  to the in-process runtime, so a rejected or failed tool call is neither executed
  twice nor replaced by a locally produced error (Refs #574).

- Make `openminion run` acknowledge delivery of its returned one-shot reply, so a
  follow-up `run --session <id>` executes the new input instead of replaying the
  settled first turn; continuing that thread still requires `--resume` (Refs #556).

- Parse porcelain v2 rename/copy records without the rename score and old-path suffix, keeping the destination path (including spaces). (Refs #491)

- Reject unsupported arithmetic in `calculate_expression` — zero to a negative power and complex-valued results now use the structured `INVALID_ARGUMENT` path instead of raising raw exceptions. (Refs #490)

- Support positional-only parameters in `@tool` handlers, so a function with a positional-only argument no longer crashes during argument binding. (Refs #474)

- Record the memory-consolidation marker only when the review resolved every
  candidate with a terminal decision (keep/promote/discard) and nothing was
  deferred or failed to write. A cycle that deferred any candidate, or whose
  writes partly failed, leaves `last_consolidation_state_hash` untouched, so
  those still-`proposed` candidates stay eligible for the next consolidation
  cycle instead of being blocked as already consolidated. Such a cycle still
  reports the terminal writes it did make (`PARTIALLY_CONSOLIDATED`) rather than
  claiming nothing was consolidated (Refs #477).

- Normalize raw SQLite bm25 scores in the correct direction, so a stronger match scores higher instead of lower. (Refs #479)

- Keep runtime migration 14 portable to SQLite older than 3.33: the
  join-sequence backfill now uses a correlated subquery instead of
  `UPDATE ... FROM`, preserving the per-session `(joined_at, id)` numbering on
  SQLite and PostgreSQL (Refs #564).

- Write provider settings to one place: `config init` no longer emits a duplicate
  `system.providers` mirror, so editing the top-level `providers` block takes
  effect on the next load. Older system-only configs and deliberate mixed input
  keep their existing load precedence (Refs #566).

- Keep the Focus PTY test emulator cursor aligned with rows clipped during resize,
  preventing stale composer copies during split redraws. Runtime rendering and
  the existing layout assertions are unchanged (Refs #569).

## Current package line - 2026-11-01

- Recognize Ubuntu 26.04's system coreutils directory for allowlisted host
  commands. Commands such as `whoami` resolve through `/usr/bin` symlinks to
  `/usr/lib/cargo/bin/coreutils`; that specific directory is now trusted by
  default. Executable-name restrictions, resolved-target checks, host-execution
  enablement, approvals and explicit trusted-directory overrides still apply
  (Refs #557).

- Honor `since_ts`/`until_ts` in the in-memory audit store. `MemoryAuditStore`
  ignored the time-window filters when listing audit records; it now filters
  by `since_ts` and `until_ts` the same way the SQLite store does (Refs #489).

- Add interactive session naming: `/rename <name>` sets the active session's
  runtime name (its `name` metadata field), and `openminion --resume "<name>"`
  (alias `-c`) resumes the session with that name, scoped to the current agent
  and directory with most-recent duplicate ordering. This runtime name is
  distinct from the standalone `sessctl` session `title` field, which lives in
  a separate session store.

- Reject duplicate Handoff resolved names when an agent is built or a delegate
  family is compiled, so two handoffs resolving to the same name fail with an
  actionable message instead of a `profile_id values must be unique` error at
  registration time (Refs #476).

- Resolve reasoning-effort support by the execution route actually selected.
  The direct OpenAI/Anthropic/Groq/Cerebras/OpenRouter adapters never carry the
  effort in their request payloads, so they no longer claim `supported=true`
  for it; the llmctl bridge and the ollama adapter (which maps the effort to an
  explicit `think` flag) still do, and echo is never labeled as transmitted
  effort (Refs #481).

- Close the call-owned storage probe on every health service exit so the
  probe's storage handle is released on all exit paths (Refs #487).

- Make the filesystem blob store's repeated put of the same bytes idempotent:
  `put_bytes` and `put_file` reuse the existing representation and preserve its
  first-write metadata, and `gc` evicts every owned payload of an evicted
  digest together with its metadata sidecar so the digest is not left reachable
  through a sibling representation, accounts for eviction at the same digest
  unit it deletes at, and ignores unrelated files that merely share a digest's
  hash prefix (Refs #484).

- Add a cross-machine A2A HTTP transport with mandatory token auth. The new
  `HTTPTransport` client and stdlib `A2AHTTPServer`/`serve_a2a` server let two
  OpenMinion machines call each other's agents over HTTP, and `a2actl serve`
  (with `--host`/`--port`/`--token`, generating a secret when omitted) plus
  `a2actl call --url ... --token ...` expose it from the CLI. The server binds
  to `127.0.0.1` by default, requires a non-empty `Bearer` token on every
  endpoint, and serves a Google-A2A-style agent card at
  `/.well-known/agent.json`. This is an OpenMinion custom endpoint transport
  (its `/a2a/...` endpoints speak OpenMinion's own `Envelope` JSON), not a
  complete interoperable Google A2A protocol server; `a2actl serve` only
  registers the built-in `agent.echo`/`agent.worker` demo agents, which do not
  demonstrate cross-machine calls to configured application agents. Error
  code/message/details are preserved across the wire. See
  `docs/a2a-remote.md`.

- Keep native structured-output instructions limited to formatting so research
  synthesis can answer from supplied evidence. Preserve forced `submit_output`,
  schema validation, and caller-owned routing/judgment contracts (Refs #530).

- Give the first two decision turns the normal `2,200`-token context-pack
  target instead of the former `1,500`-token target. This leaves more room for
  the user's initial request, instructions and early clarification without
  changing later-turn scaling, completion budgets, provider output limits or
  saved agent profiles.

- Stage no `tool_outcome` memory candidate for an outcome classified as
  `policy_denied`. When the user denied a tool call, or the call was still
  waiting for the user's confirmation, the brain staged a `policy_denied`
  `tool_outcome` candidate in agent scope whose content and metadata held the
  call's arguments, also when the agent's memory policy allowed the write. No
  candidate is now staged for any `policy_denied` outcome: an ask-user command
  returned for a tool call, such as the user's denial, a pending confirmation
  or a policy denial, and a tool result with status `needs_user` or
  `blocked`, which includes a tool that ran and returned
  `requires_user_takeover`. Failure, timeout and allowlisted success
  candidates, the turn's `memory.write` answer and the policy and approval
  events are unchanged (Refs #524).

- Give each PostgreSQL module its own schema, and refuse a layout whose
  ownership is not proven before any table is written. Runtime storage and
  every module wrote into the one schema the configured URL selects, so they
  shared `alembic_version` and `om_meta`, and `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`
  let one owner adopt another's `sessions`, `events`, `idempotency_keys`,
  `memory_records`, `migrations` or `agents`. Runtime storage keeps that
  schema; each module now uses `<base>__<module id>`, created inside its
  migration transaction (or, for a store without Alembic, in its own
  transaction before its first table), on a connection that keeps the URL's
  options and adds `-c search_path`. A module whose history is already in the
  base schema, such as a dedicated PostgreSQL memory database, stays there
  with no move or stamp. A table counts as an owner's only when that owner's
  ledger is recorded in the schema and the table exactly matches one listed
  for that ledger in `postgres_histories.json`, which was measured from every
  published release and this code. An existing `<base>__<module id>` is used
  only when it is empty or holds the module's proven history; one with tables
  but no ledger of the module, such as a first start stopped before
  `om_meta`, is refused. A shared or unknown layout, for example
  the A2A audit store on the runtime URL, or memory first and then runtime
  storage, is refused with a message that names its tables, for the owners
  that use them only. Upgrade: run `openminion storage migrate --backend
  postgres` before the module stores start, and connect the module stores
  directly or through a pooler that passes the `options` startup parameter.
  `docs/runtime-database-upgrades.md` gives the details and the operator's
  relocation steps (Refs #446).

- Document the upgrade for memory consolidation jobs from packages before
  0.1.15. Since 0.1.15 the daemon runs a job as memory consolidation only when
  its task record has the `memory_consolidation` kind that
  `task.consolidate_memory` stores. A job created by `task.consolidate_memory`
  of a package before 0.1.15, or any job with the reserved payload and no such
  record, fails its first run with the provenance message, without a turn or
  capture recovery, and is paused. `docs/runtime-database-upgrades.md` now
  describes how to inspect those jobs, cancel or pause each one before
  creating its replacement through `task.consolidate_memory`, and check that
  the old job is not enabled and the replacement is, for the same agent; that
  jobs created by 0.1.15 or later keep running next to the replacements and
  are not replaced on later upgrades; that the raw cron API rejects the
  reserved payload; and that pending capture intents are kept and recovered as
  before. New tests create the job through the tool's handler and run it
  through the daemon's scheduler, whose own task manager reads the stored kind
  (Refs #456).

- Let `Agent.run()` and `Agent.run_stream()` answer a waiting confirmation.
  A second `run()` after "Policy confirmation required." started a new thread,
  so the reply did not reach the tool call waiting on the first one. Both
  methods now accept an optional `thread_id` that sends the turn to that
  thread, and `AgentRunResult.thread_id` returns the turn's thread. Omitted or
  blank, it changes nothing (Refs #541).

- Order the `memory` and `self_awareness` context segments before
  `turn_input` so that recalled memories and the self model render ahead of
  the final user input (Refs #483).

- Honour `Field` defaults and `default_factory` declared inside `Annotated`
  (e.g. `x: Annotated[int, Field(default=5)]` or
  `x: Annotated[list[int], Field(default_factory=list)]`) when a `@tool`
  argument has no Python default, while still preserving `Field` defaults,
  `default_factory`, aliases and constraints declared as the argument's Python
  default (e.g. `x: int = Field(default=7, alias="external", ge=1)` or
  `x: list[int] = Field(default_factory=list)`) (Refs #475).

- Apply the recent-window mode budget bias (respond halving / act -120) only
  once. The recent-window trimmer read the already-biased budget and applied
  the mode adjustment a second time, halving the respond budget or subtracting
  120 tokens from the act budget again; it now reads the biased budget
  directly, so the adjustment lands exactly once (Refs #482).

## Current package line - 2026-10-29

- Ask the agent's `memory.write` authorization before a turn captures memory.
  A turn's auto fact extraction and its capture bundle write ran without a
  policy decision, so with an identity hard constraint such as `NEVER write
  memory records` an ordinary turn still wrote its candidate, receipt and
  `memory.capture.result`, while pending-capture recovery was refused for the
  same capture. The brain bridge now asks once per turn, with the check and
  internal actor that recovery uses and the turn's channel, session and root
  turn. When the write is not allowed, including when it needs approval, the
  turn makes no extraction request, writes nothing for its capture and asks no
  approval for it, and its reply is unchanged. Its intent stays pending with
  `CAPTURE_RECOVERY_UNAUTHORIZED`, and recovery commits it once the write is
  allowed. A diagnostic turn (`openminion agent-check` and the turn smoke
  check of `openminion doctor`), whose capture is disabled, no longer makes
  the extraction request whose result it never wrote (Refs #448).

- Close what a failed `APIRuntime` start built. When a start step raised,
  what the start had already built stayed open: the runtime storage (its
  SQLite connection, or the PostgreSQL connection pool and its pool-health
  emitter thread), the telemetry store, the module databases and the
  services. The caller got the original error, but those objects stayed open
  until a garbage collection freed them, and the PostgreSQL pool and emitter
  not even then. Each step of the start now closes what it built with the
  existing closes and re-raises the original error, also when one of those
  closes fails. Once the runtime object exists, a later failure closes it
  with `APIRuntime.close()`, which also stops a runtime manager that already
  started. A successful start hands the same objects to the runtime as
  before (Refs #447).
- Find the compress module's migrations in `openminion storage migrate`.
  Migration discovery looked for a module's storage package as
  `openminion.modules.<id>.storage`, but the compress package is
  `openminion.modules.context.compress.storage`, so `storage migrate --module
  compress` and compress's own `run_migrations` failed with `Alembic
  configuration missing` on SQLite and PostgreSQL and wrote nothing.
  Discovery's map of nested module packages now lists compress, as it lists
  `authoring` and `commerce`, and compress migrates to `0001_baseline` with
  its tables. The compress migration and discovery for other modules are
  unchanged (Refs #493).

- Skip a turn's decision record and tool outcome candidate when the agent's
  `memory.write` is not allowed. The brain wrote a `decision` record for every
  routed turn and staged a `tool_outcome` candidate for a refused tool call,
  with the call's arguments, without asking the memory policy, so with an
  identity hard constraint such as `NEVER write memory records` a refused
  `memory.write` call still left its content in the memory candidates. Both
  writes now use the turn's `memory.write` answer, which the brain bridge asks
  on every turn, including scheduled consolidation and diagnostic turns. When
  it is not `allow`, including when it needs approval, the decision record is
  skipped (`brain.decision_memory.skipped`, `memory_write_not_authorized`) and
  no candidate is staged. The working state keeps the decision metadata, and
  nothing asks for approval for these writes (Refs #496).
- Keep a room's selected active agent a participant when the selection runs
  at the same time as a leave of that agent on another connection.
  `set_active_agent` checked that the agent was an active participant and
  then wrote `active_agent_id` in a separate statement, outside the
  session-row lock that joins and leaves take, so a leave (`/kick`) could
  commit between the two and the selection (`/activate`) then stored an agent
  that had left. The selection now reads the agent's membership after taking
  that lock and writes the active agent in the same transaction. A leave
  during a selection waits for it to commit and then runs its fallback; a
  selection during a leave waits for it and is refused with the existing
  `Agent ... is not an active participant` error. The errors and the
  returned session are unchanged (Refs #495).
- Migrate the `controlplane` and `telemetry` modules on PostgreSQL. Their
  `0001_baseline` revisions applied SQLite's `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
  AUTOINCREMENT` on every dialect, so `openminion storage migrate --backend
  postgres --module controlplane` and `--module telemetry` failed with a
  syntax error and wrote nothing. On PostgreSQL they now create the column
  types the modules' PostgreSQL stores already use: `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY` ids
  and a `DOUBLE PRECISION` telemetry timestamp. Tables the stores created
  before the migration are kept with their rows; an existing table whose id
  or timestamp has another type stops the upgrade with an error naming the
  column, and nothing is written. The controlplane store also opens a
  database the baseline created, where it failed with a duplicate
  `next_attempt_at` column, on SQLite too. The SQLite DDL and the revisions
  are unchanged (Refs #494).

## Current package line - 2026-10-28

- Start `APIRuntime` with PostgreSQL runtime storage (`storage.backend:
  postgres`). The start read the runtime record store's SQLite connection for
  every backend and failed with `runtime record_store does not expose sqlite
  connection`, so commands such as `openminion room create` exited with a
  startup error. `APIRuntime.storage_connection`, and the compatibility
  wrapper's `OpenMinionRuntime.storage`, are now the SQLite connection on
  SQLite, unchanged, and `None` for other backends; sessions and rooms go
  through `runtime.sessions` on either backend. A SQLite record store without
  a connection still fails the start with the same error. What is covered on
  PostgreSQL is listed in `docs/runtime-database-upgrades.md` (Refs #437).
- Report the migration error in `openminion storage migrate` entries. When a
  module's `MigrationReport` failed, its entry had status `error` but no
  message, and the text output printed only `FAIL <module>`. The entry now
  carries the report's `error`, and the text line prints it after the module
  id. The `applied` list is left out: it read a field that `MigrationReport`
  does not have, so it was always empty. Exit status is unchanged (Refs
  #446).
- Keep a room's active agent when a first agent join runs at the same time as
  another join, an explicit selection or a leave on another connection. The
  join read the room after its participant row had committed and, when the
  room had no active agent, wrote its agent as active in a separate
  statement. A second join could then replace the first activation, a join
  could overwrite a `set_active_agent` selection (`/activate`), and a join
  whose agent left meanwhile (`/kick`) stored that agent as active. The join
  now reads and writes the active agent in its participant transaction, under
  the session-row lock that joins and leaves already take, with the same
  empty or blank check. The first activation a join commits stays until a
  selection or a leave changes it, and a selection or leave made during a
  join waits for it to commit, then applies. The active agent is still not
  guaranteed to be the earliest join. Legacy owner records still activate no
  agent (Refs #393).

- Stop pending-capture recovery from calling the extraction model for an
  intent that the current memory store cannot commit. After the identity and
  authorization checks, recovery asks the memory owners whether the store can
  commit an atomic capture bundle (`supports_capture_bundles()`, the existing
  method check, now readable without a write). With a backend without
  `apply_capture_bundle`, such as `reference-sqlite`, each intent stays pending
  with its counts and `CAPTURE_RECOVERY_UNSUPPORTED` diagnostic, and no source
  message is read and no extraction request is made; before, every memory
  consolidation run extracted again for each pending intent up to its
  `batch_limit`. The same intents are recovered once the agent uses a store
  that can commit them. Under the audit wrapper, a store without the method,
  such as the in-memory store, is now reported the same way; before, recovery
  extracted and then raised `AttributeError`. A memory API without the new
  predicate keeps the previous order, and the bundle write and its errors are
  unchanged (Refs #449).

- Preserve scheduler-owned memory-consolidation context through runtime ingress
  and gateway prompts, reject raw cron creation of reserved consolidation
  payloads, and pause unverifiable legacy jobs with clear recreation guidance.
- Report the configured telemetry exporter posture consistently, including
  empty and error states, and connect invocation telemetry to current and recent
  token usage without exposing content by default.
- Harden MCP interoperability by refreshing tool definitions once after a
  protocol header mismatch, enforcing the 1 MiB SSE event boundary, and
  validating the official Python SDK 2.3.0 client/server paths.
- Close artifact lifecycle gaps by validating retention inputs, normalizing
  alias expiry, preserving historical cleanup, and carrying the existing
  retrieval controller through durable tool ingestion with per-item failure
  isolation.
- Complete task lifecycle controls across Focus, CLI, and API with canonical
  policy, run-now, scheduler status, bounded history, deterministic one-shot
  behavior, and trusted cron/watch metadata. Live MiniMax acceptance confirmed
  material-change watch delivery without runtime-owned semantic parsing.
- Add opt-in isolated source, image, AWS snapshot, and local web/API security
  assessments with bounded recurring evidence, SARIF export, exact finding
  comparisons, cancellation, expiry, revision limits, and canonical closure
  verdicts. Remote, cloud, and login assessment remain outside this release.

## Current package line - 2026-10-27

- Document what `openminion storage backup` covers in a SQLite runtime home.
  The command snapshots one file and refuses the module databases that carry
  their own `application_id` (artifact, authored tools, brain, identity,
  memory, policy, retrieve, skill and telemetry). The upgrade guide now lists
  the files of a default runtime home with the command's result for each,
  and backs up the refused ones with SQLite's backup API while every writer
  is stopped. For a rollback it checks each backup first, then moves each
  database aside together with its `-journal`, `-wal` and `-shm` before it
  puts the backups in place, so a companion left by a writer that did not
  finish is neither applied to a restored file nor deleted. It also states
  where the brain working state gets `turn_evidence` and
  `turn_evidence_trace_id`: the typed save adds them, while the turn-start
  reset rewrites the stored state with its existing keys, so the first row a
  runtime turn writes after the upgrade can lack both. The working state
  lives in the brain's session store, not in the runtime database
  (`docs/runtime-database-upgrades.md`, Refs #452, #419).

- Accept the canonical `time.now` tool's `utc` timestamp as exact-date
  evidence. Current-date answers that successfully called the time tool no
  longer fail the freshness verifier after receiving a grounded timestamp.
- Close what a runtime memory assembly build obtained when the build fails
  partway. The artifact store, and the memory store with its audit sink for
  the built-in backend, are closed once each through their current owner,
  and the build's own error reaches the caller even when a close fails. A
  PostgreSQL memory store disposes its engine instead of keeping a server
  connection. Successful builds hand both to the assembly as before
  (Refs #390).
- Pass validated Pydantic-model and dataclass arguments to `@tool` functions
  as instances instead of plain dicts. The decorator handler called
  `model_dump()` on the validated arguments, so a tool typed `span: Range`
  received a `dict` and failed with `AttributeError`. The handler now
  validates mappings with the tool's args model, accepting both declared
  aliases and canonical field names, and passes the validated field values;
  defaults and `Annotated` constraints apply and invalid mappings raise
  `ValidationError`. With Pydantic before 2.11, a nested model that declares
  aliases is accepted by alias only. This changes the decorator handler
  only: the shared built-in tool mapping contract is unchanged, so a normal
  SDK `Agent.run` call with an aliased argument, top-level or nested, is
  still rejected before the handler runs, as it is without this change. That
  runtime alias bug is tracked in #454 (Refs #435).
- Make `python -m openminion.modules.storage` exit with the status that
  storagectl's `main()` returns, as `python -m openminion.modules.storage.cli`
  already does. A command that prints `"ok": false` and returns 2, such as
  `pool-stats` without a PostgreSQL URL, now exits 2 instead of 0. The
  printed output is unchanged, and a command that raises still exits 1
  (Refs #450, #412).

## Current package line - 2026-10-26 update

- Raise the default tool budgets for longer real-world tasks to 160 calls per
  run, 80 calls per tool, 320 weighted tool-cost units, and 64 adaptive tool
  calls. Explicit saved limits and independent client timeouts remain
  unchanged (Refs #438).
- Check an entry step's text answer against the turn's typed freshness
  obligations before it ends the turn, as a judge's closing answer is
  checked. The respond route now finalizes the entry text with
  `final_close_message`: an answer whose evidence meets the obligations is
  kept unchanged, and one without the required live-data or exact-date
  evidence becomes the existing freshness-failure message, with the
  verifier's reasons in the freshness diagnostics. This covers a first entry
  step that answers in text and a continuation step after the judge or the
  closure freshness guard continues the turn. A continuation's evidence is
  the action result the turn's execution handed to it: the working state
  keeps it with the turn's trace id (`turn_evidence`,
  `turn_evidence_trace_id`), so a lookup that would satisfy a direct close
  also satisfies the continuation's text, and a result from another turn is
  not evidence. Every working state saved from this version on contains both
  fields, and a runtime from before it rejects such a state: upgrade every
  process that shares the runtime state together and roll back only with the
  matching pre-upgrade backup (`docs/runtime-database-upgrades.md`). A state
  saved before this version loads with neither field set. Clarify questions,
  other respond decisions and the tool/judge path are unchanged (Refs #419).
- Make `storagectl restore` leave the target equal to the snapshot. storagectl
  now dispatches `restore` before it builds its `StorageEngine`, as it already
  does for `pool-stats`, `dr-drill` and `a2a-archive-old`, so its SQLite record
  store no longer holds a connection open on the database file that the
  restore replaces. On native Windows the restore failed with
  `PermissionError`; on Linux a restore onto a new path reported `ok` but left
  a database without most of the snapshot's tables. The restore's validation,
  progress reporting, JSON output and errors are unchanged (Refs #412).
- Let memory consolidation cron runs recover pending terminal capture intents
  and then submit their scheduled turn. The cron executor passed the agent
  service's keyword-only capture candidate extractor to the recovery's
  positional callback, with the runtime session store as its session API, so
  every consolidation run with a pending intent failed with `TypeError` before
  its turn. A small adapter at the cron call site now calls the extractor by
  keyword with the brain session API that the agent's runner uses for turns.
  Recovery authorization, capture identity, the capture bundle write and the
  pending/unsupported accounting are unchanged (Refs #420).
- Let `memctl inspect` run without `--scope`, or with an empty one, as the
  command intends: it inspects with the default inspection identifiers and
  reports stats for every scope, instead of exiting with a traceback from the
  scope parser. A non-empty invalid scope is now reported as
  `Error: invalid scope: ...` on stderr with exit code 1, as `memctl search`
  and `memctl list` report one, before the memory service opens. JSON and
  human output report the same normalized scope (Refs #413).
- Let `memctl gc` purge soft-deleted records with a PostgreSQL memory store.
  memctl runs gc on the `AuditedMemoryStore` it builds, and
  `purge_soft_deleted` chose its SQL by the wrapper's type, so a PostgreSQL
  store took the SQLite branch and the command exited with
  `'PostgresMemoryStore' object has no attribute '_connect'` after the
  retention pass. The purge now runs on the store the wrapper holds, using
  the one-level wrapper resolution the retention helpers use since #392,
  which moves into the purge module. The purge SQL, auditing and errors are
  unchanged (Refs #401).

## Current package line - 2026-10-26

- Keep research incomplete when synthesis fails or returns a blank answer,
  even when sources were collected. Retain checkpoint evidence for resumption
  and project-owned incomplete status; record exception types without provider
  response bodies.
- Give tool calls that a provider returns without ids a full-UUID batch
  prefix (`call_<uuid>_<n>`) instead of a bare `call_<n>`. Tool transcript
  events are keyed by turn and call id, so two id-less response batches in the
  same turn (for example Ollama with the default `fallback` tool strategy
  after the closure gate sends the turn back through entry) both produced
  `call_1` and failed the turn with `session event idempotency conflict`.
  Provider-supplied ids and batch order are unchanged, and replaying an
  already-normalized call stays idempotent (#410).

- Let SDK turns complete with an external memory backend that does not
  implement atomic capture bundles, such as the bundled `reference-sqlite`
  adapter. The backend adapter now reports the missing optional
  `apply_capture_bundle` with the existing `CaptureRecoveryUnsupportedError`
  instead of raising `NotImplementedError` out of `Agent.run`, so the turn's
  capture intent stays pending with `CAPTURE_RECOVERY_UNSUPPORTED`, as it does
  for the local JSONL memory adapter. Backends that implement the method are
  called as before, and their errors still propagate (Refs #397).
- Select run events with a case-sensitive `run.` type prefix in
  `list_session_runs` and `list_session_run_events` on SQLite, as on
  PostgreSQL and as the thread lifecycle, the invocation terminal and every
  runtime writer already do. SQLite `LIKE` matched the prefix
  case-insensitively, so on SQLite an event stored with a `RUN.` or `Run.`
  type was counted in run listings, run event lists and the run status shown
  by the runs API, `openminion status` and owner diagnostics; it no longer
  is. No runtime writer emits such a type; it can come from the generic
  event append APIs or an import. The state is still read from the type
  suffix in any case (`run.COMPLETED` is completed), stored events are not
  changed, and the generic `list_events` and `count_events` prefix filters
  are unchanged (Refs #396).
- Close the memory store and audit database that a `memctl` command opens
  when the command ends, whether it succeeds or fails. The command's service
  now owns the store and audit sink it creates and closes them once, through
  the command's Click context; a service built by the factory outside a
  command is closed by its caller with `close()`. The audit database used to
  stay open until garbage collection, so an in-process caller on Windows
  (such as typer's `CliRunner`) could not rename or delete it (Refs #403).
- Keep a turn's freshness contract, obligations and diagnostics on an entry
  step that has no new user input and no valid typed `freshness` contract,
  such as the continuation step after the closure freshness guard turns a
  close into a continue. The step used to replace them with the classifier's
  default for empty input, which dropped the exact-date, live-data and
  sources obligations the guard was enforcing. A valid typed contract still
  replaces them, new user input is still classified, and a first step with
  neither keeps the default. The step emits `brain.freshness.entry_fallback`
  with reason `retained_turn_contract` (Refs #395).
- Report the deepest key history in `memctl inspect` (`history_summary` with
  `--json`, the `Deepest history` line otherwise) for the SQLite store that
  memctl wraps in its audited store; it was always missing there. A store
  without that summary, such as PostgreSQL, and a database without keyed
  history still report none (#402).
- Let PostgreSQL memory retention and purge remove records and candidates
  that carry evidence. The shared evidence decoder now keeps the list that
  PostgreSQL returns for the JSONB `evidence_json` column, instead of parsing
  its Python text form, so confidence decay, summary retention, scope
  capacity, stale insight eviction and the purge of soft-deleted records and
  promoted or rejected candidates no longer fail with `JSONDecodeError` on an
  item with evidence, and remove its artifact refs. SQLite JSON text, empty
  values and `None` decode as before (#400).
- Close the SQLite connections that twelve storage and API runtime tests open
  themselves, and the API runtime one of them builds, before the test removes
  its temporary directory or restores the database, so these tests pass on
  native Windows as they do on Linux. Test-only; no package behaviour changes
  (#408).
- Resolve postponed (`from __future__ import annotations`) and quoted
  annotations on `@openminion.tool` functions in their own module, keeping
  `Annotated` field descriptions and constraints. Only argument annotations
  exposed in the args schema are evaluated (return, `self`/`cls` and
  `*args`/`**kwargs` annotations are left alone), and decoration fails with a
  clear `TypeError` when an exposed argument annotation cannot be resolved.
- Keep room participants that join with the same timestamp in join order, with
  a per-session join sequence that runtime migration 14 adds on SQLite and
  Postgres. `list_participants`, and the agent selected when the active agent
  leaves, no longer depend on random participant row ids. A participant added
  again while active keeps its place and join time; one that leaves and
  rejoins takes a new place after every earlier join. Explicit active-agent
  selection is unchanged. On upgrade, existing participants keep the order
  they listed in before, so participants that already share a timestamp keep
  their row id order (#364).
- Upgrade note for runtime migration 14 (#364): as for migration 13, upgrade
  every process that shares a runtime database together, keep a pre-upgrade
  backup, and do not run a binary from before this change against the
  upgraded database. An older writer stores no join place: the first
  participant it adds to a session after the upgrade lists before other joins
  with the same timestamp, adding a second one to that session fails, and a
  participant it rejoins keeps its earlier place.
- Report an internal brain runtime failure (the state machine's `fatal_error`
  path, such as a tool returning a value that cannot be JSON-serialized) as
  `run_state="failed"` on `AgentRunResult` and in the persisted run, instead of
  `"completed"`. The existing structured `error_code`, `error_message` and
  `error_details` stay in the result metadata. Recoverable tool errors that the
  brain answers without a fatal transition still complete (Refs #384).
- Close the runtime memory assembly with the `external` memory backend
  provider: the memory service closes the external backend it owns once,
  through a new `BackendMemoryStoreAdapter.close()` that does nothing for a
  backend without `close()` or one it does not own, and the assembly then
  closes its artifact store. Before, the close raised `AttributeError` and left
  the artifact store open. With this provider the assembly also no longer
  creates the memory store and audit sink that only the built-in backend uses,
  so a PostgreSQL `memory.store` setting opens no engine and an unusable
  `memory.store` setting no longer fails the build (#388).
- Apply memory retention in the runtime session lifecycle with a PostgreSQL
  memory store. The lifecycle hands the retention helpers the runtime's
  `AuditedMemoryStore`, so confidence decay, summary compression and deletion,
  per-scope capacity and stale insight eviction took the SQLite path and failed
  with `'PostgresMemoryStore' object has no attribute '_connect'`: no retention
  was applied, every turn logged `memory.session_lifecycle failed`, and the
  first-turn summary compression failed silently. The helpers now run on the
  store behind the audit wrapper, as they already did with SQLite, and the
  lifecycle completes once per session (#392).
- Close the memory store, audit sink and artifact store that the bootstrap
  memory fallback creates. When `build_gateway_service` builds the agent memory
  itself, `GatewayService.close()` now closes it once, and the adapter that
  `build_agent_memory_service` returns gets a `close()` that closes the runtime
  memory assembly behind it once, keeping the scheduler boundary. Before, the
  assembly was dropped and nothing could close them. An `agent_memory` passed
  to the gateway service stays borrowed, and the SDK runtime's memory gateway
  still closes nothing itself (#389).
- Session metadata filters work on PostgreSQL.
  `list_sessions(metadata_filter=...)`, which ACP `session/list` and Focus
  directory sessions use, emitted SQLite's `json_extract` and failed there.
  Runtime migration 15 adds `session_metadata_strings`: one row for each
  top-level member of a session's stored metadata whose value is a string,
  written by the session store in the same transaction as every session
  insert, metadata update and delete, on SQLite and PostgreSQL. The migration
  backfills existing sessions in batches inside its transaction, reading each
  stored `metadata_json` with `json.loads`, so metadata PostgreSQL cannot parse
  (NaN, Infinity, an escaped NUL or a lone surrogate) is covered; stored
  metadata is not changed, and a session whose metadata is not JSON rolls the
  migration back and is named in the error. On PostgreSQL a filter selects a
  session whose stored metadata, as `SessionRecord.metadata` reads it, has a
  top-level member named exactly as the key whose value is a string equal to
  the filter value. Names and values are literal; numbers, booleans, null,
  objects and arrays never match; and at most `limit` sessions are read.
  `list_sessions` still sends a false filter value (`None`, `0`, `False`, an
  empty container) as `""`, so `{"surface": None}` matches an empty string as
  before; PostgreSQL raises `TypeError` for any other filter value that is not
  a string, where SQLite compares it as an SQL value. SQLite keeps its
  `json_extract` reader, so the backends still differ where it reads more
  than a literal top-level string: keys as JSON paths, objects and arrays by
  their minified text, version-dependent escaped keys and NaN documents, and
  the first of two members with one name. A `SessionStore` built directly on a
  `RecordStorePostgres` now uses the PostgreSQL reader: the SQL comes from the
  record store's type, with no SQLite default. See
  `docs/runtime-database-upgrades.md` (#369).
- Upgrade note for runtime migration 15 (#369): stop every process that writes
  the runtime database, keep a pre-upgrade backup, upgrade all of them
  together, and never run a binary from before this change against the
  migrated database. Rolling back requires restoring the matching pre-upgrade
  backup. An older writer does not maintain `session_metadata_strings`: a
  session it creates has no rows, so a PostgreSQL metadata filter misses it,
  and a session whose metadata it changes keeps the rows of its earlier
  metadata, so a filter can return it for a value it no longer has (a stale
  match) or miss it for its new value.
- Let a parsed memory config select the `remote` store backend.
  `resolve_memory_backend` now reads the `StoreConfig` fields that
  `load_config` fills (`remote_endpoint`, `remote_timeout_seconds`,
  `remote_max_retries`) from a `MemctlConfig` or its `store`, so `memctl` with
  a `store.backend: remote` config file no longer fails with
  `remote backend requires remote.endpoint`. The configured timeout and retries
  are kept, including `max_retries: 0`. A nested `remote` mapping in a
  dictionary config still takes precedence as a whole, with its defaults
  unchanged (#391).

## Current package line - 2026-10-14

- Expose decorated tools passed through `Agent(tools=...)` to the model while
  keeping temporary exposure profiles scoped to each run and collision-free.
- Preserve complete string and falsey tool results, and surface typed provider
  failures after retry exhaustion instead of reporting successful completion.
- Roll back partial tool-family registrations and revoke removed exposure
  profiles without disturbing pre-existing tools or permissions.
- Restore approval-replay tool history from the canonical session transcript
  so failed-command recovery keeps the original tool context.
- Propagate turn cancellation into worker calls and bound provider I/O by the
  remaining deadline; stop subsequent work and late assistant persistence (#258).
- Settle pending asynchronous work when a turn exits so cancelled or timed-out
  operations cannot leak into later runtime work.
- Preserve functional tool-decorator options and expose explicitly supplied
  handoff tools through the existing temporary profile lifecycle (#259, #257).
- Export the existing `TurnTimeoutError` and handle it in the SDK error example
  (#260). Invalid streamed approval decisions now raise `ValueError`; valid
  decisions remain `allow_once` and `deny` (#261).
- Reject MCP approval risk levels outside `low`, `medium`, and `high` (#262).

## Current package line - 2026-10-12

- Generalize approval-bound blockchain operations with atomic, session-safe
  preparations, durable lifecycle facts, and optional read-only child-agent
  delegation for research and resolution.
- Preserve exact agent and session delegation scope across CLI and Desktop
  requests while retaining unscoped CLI defaults.
- Fix child-workspace path handling, detect unavailable sandbox execution before
  approval, and preserve canonical terminal outcomes when later provider work
  fails.
- Classify bounded network diagnostics as read-only, turn command allowlist
  misses into exact approval requests, preserve denylist and install blocks,
  and stop cleanly after denial.
- Make file trash recoverable through Send2Trash; fail without deletion when
  recovery is unavailable, including the memory backend.
- Preserve original bytes on invalid UTF-8 writes and edits, and retain newline
  sequences outside edited spans.
- Return accurate large-file line ranges and search completeness, and honor
  search-root-relative globs. A range starting beyond EOF now fails explicitly.
- Preserve non-secret configuration settings during export while removing
  credential headers and nested channel secrets.
- Preflight patch hunks before mutation, handle grep patterns beginning with a
  dash and filenames containing colons, and enforce descendant read policies
  across code search, maps, indexes and symbol discovery.
- Request complete unsigned cross-platform runtime binaries after final PyPI
  releases and require public checksum readback while stable binary promotion
  remains protected by signing and qualification gates.

## Current package line - 2026-10-08

- Compose commerce order care through authored skills and the existing task and
  tool runtime while preserving exact approvals, persistence, migration history,
  replay safety, and uncertain-result recovery.
- Converge four permission postures across configuration, Focus, runtime policy,
  and status reporting, with automatic read-only approval and durable,
  revocable session grants.
- Generalize tool exposure and confirmation ownership without adding a parallel
  registry or weakening authorization for writes and external effects.
- Add discovery-only blockchain configuration plus researched-contract
  resolution and an approval-bound, durable transaction lifecycle with typed
  transport evidence and race-safe recovery.
- Harden browser, code, policy, confirmation replay, and Focus smoke paths found
  during provider-backed MiniMax validation.

## Current package line - 2026-10-07

- Type the existing submitted-turn stream and result lifecycle, including
  cancellation and approval resolution, without adding another SDK runtime.
- Expose existing timeout, approval, cancellation, result metadata, and usage
  facts through the public Agent facade and ship PEP 561 typing metadata.
- Fail clearly when decorated tools lack the canonical runtime registry or a
  runtime omits its canonical response body; preserve `0.1.x` support for one
  schema-valid JSON object wrapped in provider prose.
- Retain opt-in successful workflow observations in the existing Skill store
  and expose read-only authoring readiness without changing skill activation or
  model-owned selection.
- Preserve delegated artifact verification, complete structured tool evidence,
  durable blockchain preparations, exact approval identity, and reliable Focus
  prompt submission and completion behavior.
- Add a config-disabled commerce order lifecycle foundation with exact
  one-time approvals, durable submit-once recovery, tracking, cancellation,
  return and refund preparation, typed handoff, and deterministic evidence.
  Production commerce remains unavailable until a provider passes sandbox and
  release gates.

## Current package line - 2026-10-06

- Harden the public Agent SDK with decorated-tool support, isolated sessions,
  project and profile configuration, typed provider failures, deterministic
  cleanup, and reliable structured-output decoding.

  follow the same readiness and completion checks as ordinary prompts.
- Stabilize API shutdown ordering, optional runtime startup imports, and
  provider-free execution in isolated checkouts.
- Require clean wheel and source-distribution installation checks on Linux,
  macOS, and Windows before publication.

  Focus and model-neutral tool evidence gates.

## Prior package line - 2026-09-18

- Keep published runtime feed and immutable record JSON compatible with the
  single-version-owner guard, while continuing to reject duplicate live
  version literals in source, scripts and unrelated release files.

  protected publication, pinned-record hashes and merge-commit ancestry.

## Prior package line - 2026-09-17

- Raised shared execution defaults to 100 tool calls per run, 50 calls per
  tool, 200 weighted tool-cost units, 100 loop steps and a 300-second brain
  turn budget. JSON parsing and standalone policy now use the same defaults.
  Explicit saved limits remain unchanged; mode-specific and client timeouts
  still apply independently.
